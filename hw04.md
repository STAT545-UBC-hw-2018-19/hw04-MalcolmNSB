HW04: Tidy data and joins

Data reshaping
--------------

**Problem:** You have data in one “shape” but you wish it were in another. Usually this is because the alternative shape is superior for presenting a table, making a figure, or doing aggregation and statistical analysis.

**Solution:** Reshape your data. For simple reshaping, gather() and spread() from tidyr will suffice. Do the thing that is possible / easier now that your data has a new shape.

Prompt \#2: Make a tibble with one row per year and columns for life expectancy for two or more countries from gapminder.

First we load the tidyverse package and gapminder dataframe.

``` r
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gapminder))
```

``` r
fr_uk_lifeExp <- gapminder %>% 
  rename(Year = year) %>% 
  filter(country == "France" | country == "United Kingdom") %>% 
  select(Year, country, lifeExp) %>% 
  spread(key = "country", value = "lifeExp")
```

-   Use `knitr::kable()` to make this table look pretty in your rendered homework.

``` r
knitr::kable(fr_uk_lifeExp)
```

|  Year|  France|  United Kingdom|
|-----:|-------:|---------------:|
|  1952|  67.410|          69.180|
|  1957|  68.930|          70.420|
|  1962|  70.510|          70.760|
|  1967|  71.550|          71.360|
|  1972|  72.380|          72.010|
|  1977|  73.830|          72.760|
|  1982|  74.890|          74.040|
|  1987|  76.340|          75.007|
|  1992|  77.460|          76.420|
|  1997|  78.640|          77.218|
|  2002|  79.590|          78.471|
|  2007|  80.657|          79.425|

-   Take advantage of this new data shape to scatterplot life expectancy for one country against that of another.
